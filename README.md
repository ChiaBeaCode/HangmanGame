# Hangman

A simple yet intruging game to put your guessing skills to the test!

## How to play:

You will be given a category as a hint as to what the word is associated with. You can use either your keyboard or the available letter rack to input your guesses, but if you exceed 5 incorrect guesses, the game will end. Good luck!

## Purpose:

Hangman offered me a fun approach of practicing my growing interest and skills using TypeScript.

## Tech used:

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
